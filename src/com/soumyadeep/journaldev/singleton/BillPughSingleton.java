	 * Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the
	 * singleton class. When the singleton class is loaded, SingletonHelper class is
	 * not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance method,
	 * this class gets loaded and creates the Singleton class instance.
	 * 
	 * This is the most widely used approach for Singleton class as it doesn’t
	 * require synchronization. I am using this approach in many of my projects and
	 * it’s easy to understand and implement also.
